Firearms are a recently-developed projectile weapon.  They use explosive powder to launch metal pellets as opposed to the arrows and fully-manual operation of their more traditional counterparts.  Dangerous, unreliable, and costly to operate, these weapons extremely low adoption rates among huntsman and are widely viewed as a fad.  

These weapons are often referred to as "guns", and those who wield them, "gunslingers".
