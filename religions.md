Néeark is a world where the Gods (as some choose to refer to these powerful beings) play a very strong role in the Material Plane. From the Primary Pantheon, responsible for the creation of Néeark, to the Deities worshipped by the Goblins, to the Arch-Fey who rule over the Feywild, Gods have long had a prominent place among the people.
