The Path of the Shaman is a path entrenched in the duality of nature, both nourishing, full of the wonders of life and destructive, with the fury of quaking earth and raging fire.  Reactions to these enigmatic warriors tend to be strong - many tribes hand them positions of power as healers or leaders, but some shun them and exile them from their tribes.

## Fury of the Land
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you must declare your attunement to the land.
- *Arctic* - Once per turn while raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level as a blast of frigid wind slams into it.  The extra damage is cold.
- *Coast* - Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Dexterity saving through (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, the creature becomes waterlogged and suffers from half-movement speed for the remainder of the turn. 
- *Desert* - Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Dexterity saving through (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, a burst of stinging sand causes the creature to have disadvantage on its next attack.
- *Forest* - Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a melee attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level as a flurry of thorns swarms around it.  The extra damage is piercing.
- *Grassland* - Upon entering a rage, your movement speed is increased by 10 until the end of your first turn.
- *Mountain* - Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving through (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you slam into the creature with the strength of the mountains.  The creature is knocked prone.
- *Swamp* - Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a melee attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level as a flurry of thorns swarms around it.  The extra damage is poison.

You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class, or spend 1 week in communion with a new terrain.

## Shamanistic Traditions
Through your connection with the land, you gain the ability to cast spells at the third level.  You learn three cantrips: *Druidcraft* and two others of your choice at 10th level.  Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic is drawn from the land around you. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom Modifier
- **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom Modifier
- **Ritual Casting** = You can cast any druid spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.
