## Appearance

## History
I was raised by my Wood Elf mother who fell in love with a Firbolg and traveled north from Kyria Pol, we settled down in the frozen wastes of Ar surrounded by Goliaths and Firbolg. We lived on the outskirts as it was a quite a scene to see the two together.

Survival was tough, my father was always out wandering for food and my mother was always at home telling me I was destined for great things one day. This is what led to the distance that grew between my mother and I. As I matured I craved knowledge and adventure, joining a small monastery south-west of Ar.

Friends were not necessary to my purpose, I only needed myself. I hope to find answers, discovering all this world has to offer for a Wood Elf with a Firbolg father. Spiritual enlightenment and tremendous knowledge of the unknown is what I seek.

During my travels, I settled down to meditate, calming my mind and opening my chakra as the monks had taught me. As my vision darkened, I saw Kyria Pol, a small world adrift in a sea of black. I watched as a wall of ice and snow wind raced across Kyria Pol, destroying all life on the planet. As the planet died, a large blue blade appeared from the darkness, hurtling towards the heart of NÃ©eark.

Eventually, I arrived in Kyria Pol, the birthplace of my Mother, where I took my spirituality and martial arts skills to the next level by joining The Hunt.
