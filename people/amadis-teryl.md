Hunt Mistress Amadis Teryl is the current leader of [The Hunt](/factions/the-hunt).

Amadis Tyrel was named the Mistress of The Hunt by The Hunt's former Master, Inorad. A pale white Tiefling, she has deep black hair and striking green eyes. Called "a born leader", Amadis appears at a glance to be very thin, seemingly lacking muscle of any significant amount. Though few know this, she has a deep love of cooking, often experimenting with new recipes whenever she can steal a moment to herself.

Her Speech is calm, but firm, and she is rarely given to metaphor, prefering to remain as literal as possible. She sees the nurturing of not just Kyria Pol, but all of the sentient races of NÃ©eark as her sworn duty.
