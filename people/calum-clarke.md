Calum Clarke is a half-elf ranger in The Hunt.

## Appearance
Clarke measures roughly 5'7" in height.  He has fair skin, green eyes, and thick, unkempt brown hair.  

## History
### Early Years
The bastard son of an elven father and human mother, Clarke had to learn to survive alone from a young age.  His father left before he was born and Clarke recalls little of his mother except that they seemed to frequently get separated in crowds.  The last time he saw his mother was before being caught up in a skirmish with some beasts at the city outskirts ‒ she was presumed dead after that.  
He has grown somewhat resentful of family structures and regards reliance on others as weakness.  He is still willing to offer a helping hand and will resort to being on the receiving end of such aid, albeit to the detriment of his own pride.  
He spent many of his years alone exploring the wilderness near [Ielelumé](/locations/ielelume), without venturing too far away from the coast. He developed a strong connection to nature and the ability to use some basic spells, which seemingly earning favor among some who roam the Feywoods ‒ at least as close a thing to favor as one can find in those regions.

### Joining the Hunt
After years of wandering and self-loathing, Clark made the decision to join The Hunt in search of purpose and a better life.  Despite his initial optimism, his time in Kyria Pol left disillusioned and more bitter than ever.  

## Skills
### Infernal Language
Clarke is fluent in the language of the infernals, although when actually engaged in conversation the other party seems to only talk about sucking enormous gorilla dick.  

### Sacred Hammock
Clarke preferrs not to be weighed down by attachment to the ground and will typically fashion a hammock with his immovable rod instead of making use of more traditional sleeping accommodations.  

### Tactical Bear Trap
Clarke places bear traps strategially around campsites to ensare encroaching foes.

### [Team-Killing Fucktard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08xYvO4iI_Y)
Clarke has a tendency to accidentally cause friendly fire when using [Hail of Thorns](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/hail-of-thorns).

### Canon Operator
Clarke recieved instruction on the operations of vessel-mounted cannons and was able to master the skill without paying full attention, suggesting some natural talent in the field.  

## Adversaries
### [The Wall](/locations/the-wall)
![The Wall](/wall.png)
The wall is an unscalable natural formation that Calum could not get over after four full turns of battle.

### Socializing
Social interaction remains a constant foe for Clarke.  During prolonged discourse with other individuals, we will often try to flee the scene or blend into his surroundings.  

## Affinities
### The Oar
While exploring the first lair of [Nyloth](/people/nyloth), Calum developed a strong attachment to a rowboat oar, proceeding to carry it with him across the ocean to the West Continent. 

### Lost Bear Trap
Clarke lost his original hunting trap in an encounted with tentacled foes on a river in the West Continent.  Some say the trap remains lodged to the beast as it dwells the murky depths to this day.  Only fate will tell if Clarke will ever be reunited with his precious bear trap.
