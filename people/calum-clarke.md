Calum Clarke is a half-elf ranger in The Hunt.

## Appearance
Clarke measures roughly 5'7" in height.  He has fair skin, green eyes, and thick, unkempt brown hair.  

## History
### Early Years
The bastard son of an elven father and human mother, Clarke had to learn to survive alone from a young age.  His father left before he was born and Clarke recalls little of his mother except that they seemed to frequently get separated in crowds.  The last time he saw his mother was before being caught up in a skirmish with some beasts at the city outskirts ‒ she was presumed dead after that.  
He has grown somewhat resentful of family structures and regards reliance on others as weakness.  He is still willing to offer a helping hand and will resort to being on the receiving end of such aid, albeit to the detriment of his own pride.  
He spent many of his years alone exploring the wilderness near [Ielelumé](/locations/ielelume), without venturing too far away from the coast. He developed a strong connection to nature and the ability to use some basic spells, which seemingly earning favor among some who roam the Feywoods ‒ at least as close a thing to favor as one can find in those regions.

### Joining the Hunt
After years of wandering and self-loathing, Clark made the decision to join The Hunt in search of purpose and a better life.  Despite his initial optimism, his time in Kyria Pol left disillusioned and more bitter than ever.  

## Skills
### Infernal Language
Clarke is fluent in the language of the infernals, although when actually engaged in conversation the other party seems to only talk about sucking enormous gorilla dick.  

### Sacred Hammock
Clarke preferrs not to be weighed down by attachment to the ground and will typically fashion a hammock with his immovable rod instead of making use of more traditional sleeping accommodations.  

### Tactical Bear Trap
Clarke places bear traps strategially around campsites to ensare encroaching foes.
