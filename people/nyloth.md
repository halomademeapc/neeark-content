Nyloth is a former hunt member who was discharged in 1139 [A.S.](/locations#age-of-steel) for conducting unethical experiments on small animals and monsters.  His experiments have involved using void magic on wildlife.  He is also known to flee when encountered rather than engage in combat.  

A year after his discharge, he was spotted in [Ielelum√©](/locations/ielelume) searching for new benefactors to help him continue his research.
