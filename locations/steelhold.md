Steelhold is a small mining town located at the northern-most end of [The Spine](/locations/the-spine).  Established only 100 years after [Kyria Pol](/locations/kyria-pol), it has served as the primary source of both iron and [Popo](/creatures/popo) meat, fur, and milk for its "big Sister". Though fairly far from civilization, it has managed to remain fairly prosperous, with slow, ponderous, but steady growth; though nothing compared to the larger cities.

Now housing around 50,000 souls, it is a large Town, filled with farmers, herders, miners, blacksmiths, and many of the minor trades and professions that often pop up to support those professions. \[more to come\]
