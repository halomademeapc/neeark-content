The wall is an infamous cliff face two days' travel northeast of [Kyria Pol](/locations/kyria-pol).  It is known for being a nearly insurmountable challenge to scale.  Standing 30 feet high, it menaces over any who dare attempt to ascend it.  While the portion of the cliff in question blends stealthily into its natural surroundings, there is a trick to identifying it.  Upon close inspection by a trained eye, the words "Fuck this wall" can bee seen scrawled upon its face in large type.
