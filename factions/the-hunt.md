Brimming with the best and brightest individuals in the nation, The Hunt is home to those with the strength and resolve to stand toe to toe against the creatures that roam the wilds of Néeark:  Scholars, Alchemists, Wizards, and, of course, Hunters. The Hunt's presence exists nearly everywhere, the demand for Hunters is ubiquitous across Néeark. There is very little The Hunt will not take on, provided the coin is good and the job dangerous enough.

The Hunt is headquarted in [Kyria Pol](/locations/kyria-pol).  It is currently led by Hunt Mistress [Amadis Teryl](/people/amadis-teryl).
