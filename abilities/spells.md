#### Witch Bolt (Revised)
*Evocation*

**Level:** 1

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 80 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning)

A bolt of crackling energy bursts from your fingers toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of energy between you and the creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage. Beginning on your next turn, you can use a bonus action to deal an addition 1d6 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if the target moves outside the spell's range, or if it has total cover from you.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.
