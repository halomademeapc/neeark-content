## Overview
The land of Néeark is comprised primarily of two continents, separated by two main seas: The Platinum Sea and the Northern Tides. To the West, the continent of Ineon hosts Daso, a massive forest said to nearly meld with the Feywild in many places. To the East, the continent of Priodomus houses the majority of the human population.
